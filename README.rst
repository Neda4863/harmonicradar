Harmonic Radar Simulations
===========================
These are geared towards maximum simplicity for someone wanting to understand a bit about radar.

* ``Sim917.py`` a simple look at the harmonic output of an ideal diode
* ``SimHarmonicRadar.py`` forward model of CW and FMCW (chirp) harmonic radar
