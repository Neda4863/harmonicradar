Harmonic Radar Simulations
===========================
These are geared towards maximum simplicity for someone wanting to understand a bit about radar.
I certainly have fancier things to show if you'd like to discuss offline....

* ``Sim917.py`` a simple look at the harmonic output of an ideal diode
* ``SimHarmonicRadar.py`` forward model of CW and FMCW (chirp) harmonic radar


Notes
=====
To manually compile Pygame: Linux: ``apt install libsdl2-dev``
